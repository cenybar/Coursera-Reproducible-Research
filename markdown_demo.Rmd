My First R Markdwon File
========================

This is my first R markdown file.

Here, we're going to load some data.

```{r}
library(datasets)
data(airquality)
summary(airquality)
```

Let's first make a pairs plot of the data.

```{r}
pairs(airquality)
```

Here's a regression model of ozone on wind, solar radiation, and temperature.

```{r}
library(stats)
fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Solar.R + Temp, data = airquality)
summary(fit)
```

Here's an unordered list:

- one item
- another item
- yet another item

But we can also put some order in there:

1. First I'll tell you
2. that 
3. I like
4. this ordered list
