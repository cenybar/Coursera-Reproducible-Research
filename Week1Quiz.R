1 # Suppose I conduct a study and publish my findings. Which of the following is an example of a replication of my 
# study?

# I give my data to an independent investigator at another institution, she analyzes the data and gets the same 
#results as I originally obtained. CORRECT ANSWER

#An investigator at another institution conducts a study addressing a different scientific question and publishes
# her findings.

#An investigator at another institution conducts a study addressing the same question, collects her own data, 
#analyzes it separately from me, and publishes her own findings.

#I take my own data, analyze it again, and publish new findings.

2 # Which of the following is a requirement for a published data analysis to be reproducible?

# The analysis is conducted on a variant of the Unix operating system.
# The investigator's final publication is made available free of charge.
# The full computer code for doing the data analysis is made publicly available. CORRECT ANSWER
# The data analysis is conducted using R.

3 #Which of the following is an example of a reproducible study?

#The study's analytic data and computer code are not publicly available, but the study was simple enough to be 
#repeated by an independent investigator.

#The study's analytic data are publicly available, but the computer code is not.

# The study's original authors re-run their computer code on their analytic data and confirm publicly that the 
# findings match those of the published results.

# The study's analytic data and computer code for the data analysis are publicly available. When the code is run 
# on the analytic data, the findings are identical to the published results. CORRECT ANSWER

4 # Which of the following is a reason that a study might NOT be fully replicated?

# The original study was opportunistic in its timing and it would be difficult to find a similar context in which
# to repeat it. CORRECT ANSWER

# The original study had null findings.

# The original study was conducted by a well-known investigator.

# The original study was published in a high impact journal and is considered authoritative.

5 # Which of the following is a reason why publishing reproducible research is increasingly important?
        
# New technologies are increasing the rate of data collection, creating datasets that are more complex and 
# extremely high dimensional. CORRECT ANSWER

# Most studies today are small-scale and easily replicated.

# Computing power is limited today, making it difficult to apply sophisticated statistical methods.

# The statistical methods for most studies can be accurately described using plain language.        
        

6 # What is the role of processing code in the research pipeline?

# It transforms the measured data into analytic data. CORRECT ANSWER
# It transforms the computational results into figures and tables.
# It conducts the statistical analysis of the primary outcome.
# It transforms the analytic data into computational results.

7 # Which is a goal of literate statistical programming?
        
# Separate figures and tables from other data analytic summaries.
# Require that data analysis summaries are always written in LaTeX.
# Combine explanatory text and data analysis code in a single document. CORRECT ANSWER
# Ensure that data analysis documents are always exported in PDF format.
        
8 # What does it mean to weave a literate statistical program?
    
# Transform a literate program from R to python.
# Transform the literate program into a machine readable code file.
# Transform the literate program into a human readable document. CORRECT ANSWER
# Compress the literate program so that it takes up less space.

9 # Which of the following is required to implement a literate programming system?
        
# A program that views PDF files.
# A web server for publishing documents.
# A documentation language like LaTeX. CORRECT ANSWER
# A Unix-based computer system.

10 # What is one way in which the knitr system differs from Sweave?
        
# knitr lacks features like caching of code chunks.
# knitr is written in python instead of R.
# knitr was developed by Friedrich Leisch.
# knitr allows for the use of markdown instead of LaTeX. CORRECT ANSWER
